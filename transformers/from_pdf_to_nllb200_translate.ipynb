            "[00:22.240 --> 00:28.400]  One is that e-learning sales reached over $253 billion in 2021 and e-commerce as a whole\n",

            "[00:35.040 --> 00:37.280]  Number one is because e-commerce is the method\n",
            "[00:37.280 --> 00:40.080]  that we're actually using to build these businesses.\n",
            "[00:40.080 --> 00:42.160]  We are selling things on the internet.\n",
            "[00:42.160 --> 00:45.920]  And number two is because the most profitable digital products\n",
            "[00:45.920 --> 00:50.240]  fall under the e-learning categories in these four niches,\n",
            "[00:50.240 --> 00:53.280]  health, wealth, relationships, and happiness.\n",
            "[00:53.280 --> 00:56.400]  Now there are infinite sub niches under each of these,\n",

            "[01:05.200 --> 01:08.400]  And this right here is the typical physical product\n",
            "[01:08.400 --> 01:11.400]  dropshipping business model that you may have heard of or\n",
            "[01:11.400 --> 01:15.100]  even tried to do before and I'm not going to completely hate\n",
            "[01:15.100 --> 01:16.600]  on it because I have done it in the past.\n",
            "[01:16.600 --> 01:19.000]  That's how I started my first online e-commerce business.\n",
            "[01:19.000 --> 01:22.100]  But the reality of it is that you can't really get too far\n",
            "[01:22.100 --> 01:24.700]  without encountering a lot of issues.\n",
            "[01:24.700 --> 01:28.220]  So, for an example here, I put this phone case.\n",
            "[01:28.220 --> 01:33.220]  So let's say we were going to dropship this product from overseas and from our supplier,\n",
            "[01:33.220 --> 01:35.940]  it's going to cost us $5 shipped.\n",
            "[01:35.940 --> 01:39.420]  And we could list it on our store for something like $15.\n",
            "[01:39.420 --> 01:43.660]  And with that, there is a 66% gross profit margin.\n",
            "[01:43.660 --> 01:48.940]  So a gross profit margin is just essentially the profit margin before any type of fees,\n",
            "[01:48.940 --> 01:50.700]  ad spend, et cetera.\n",
            "[01:50.700 --> 01:55.400]  And some of the biggest reasons why I stopped dropshipping physical products from China\n",
            "[01:55.400 --> 01:59.240]  and why I don't like doing it is because of one, the long shipping times.\n",
            "[01:59.240 --> 02:03.240]  That's probably the biggest factor, especially right now in the world with all the havoc\n",
            "[02:03.240 --> 02:08.000]  and delays and lots of things that just prevent efficient shipping.\n",
            "[02:08.000 --> 02:12.280]  And the second point being saturated products because literally everyone and their mother\n",
            "[02:12.280 --> 02:17.100]  in the space is trying to sell the same exact product with the same exact marketing angle\n",
            "[02:17.100 --> 02:19.680]  and it's just not going to work out like that.\n",
            "[02:19.680 --> 02:21.680]  And three, unhappy customers.\n",
            "[02:21.680 --> 02:26.520]  When you have long shipping times and a product that's quality is just not really up to par,\n",
            "[02:26.520 --> 02:31.400]  you're going to have issues like chargebacks and your ad accounts being disabled.\n",
            "[02:31.400 --> 02:34.640]  And when you have things like chargebacks, that causes you to have payment processor\n",
            "[02:34.640 --> 02:35.640]  issues.\n",
            "[02:35.640 --> 02:39.280]  So having unhappy customers is not something you want to deal with.\n",
            "[02:39.280 --> 02:41.920]  And four being razor thin margins.\n",
            "[02:41.920 --> 02:47.360]  Now, a 66% growth profit margin may sound good on paper, but the reality of it that\n",
            "[02:47.360 --> 02:49.560]  you're about to see when we compare it to the digital drop shipping\n",
            "[02:49.560 --> 02:52.860]  model is that it doesn't even compare whatsoever.\n",
            "[02:53.060 --> 02:55.760]  And the last thing here about physical product drop shipping is\n",
            "[02:55.760 --> 02:59.060]  just the overall limited reach when it comes down to shipping\n",
            "[02:59.060 --> 03:03.360]  because you are selling physical products and you can't ship\n",
            "[03:03.360 --> 03:04.660]  them to everywhere in the world.\n",
            "[03:04.660 --> 03:07.460]  Typically unless you want to pay astronomical prices to ship\n",
            "[03:07.460 --> 03:10.160]  it somewhere that you usually can now the digital product drop\n",
            "[03:10.160 --> 03:14.560]  shipping model is completely different and much more profitable.\n",
            "[03:14.760 --> 03:15.960]  And I put here as an example.\n",
            "[03:15.960 --> 03:19.460]  This is just something I picked up off Google of someone selling\n",
            "[03:19.560 --> 03:21.160]  Lightroom presets pack.\n",
            "[03:21.160 --> 03:24.960]  So essentially what this is is a pack for Adobe Lightroom, which\n",
            "[03:24.960 --> 03:28.160]  is an editing software for photos and he was selling it for\n",
            "[03:28.160 --> 03:32.760]  $45 and on that product that you're selling for $45.\n",
            "[03:32.960 --> 03:36.660]  It costs you nothing to fulfill with the gross profit margin\n",
            "[03:36.660 --> 03:40.060]  being 100% and yes, there are some costs involved which I'm\n",
            "[03:40.060 --> 03:41.760]  going to get here into in a second.\n",
            "[03:41.760 --> 03:44.560]  But some of the main benefits of the digital drop shipping\n",
            "[03:44.560 --> 03:48.260]  business model is that your products are instantly delivered.\n",
            "[03:48.260 --> 03:50.760]  So as soon as the customer buys, you can send them an email,\n",
            "[03:50.760 --> 03:53.160]  give them a download link, and they can get access to your\n",
            "[03:53.160 --> 03:56.860]  product. Number two is that you can create literally infinite\n",
            "[03:56.860 --> 04:00.060]  offers because you decide what the value of your product\n",
            "[04:00.060 --> 04:03.160]  is, what it's going to be, how it's presented, etc.\n",
            "[04:03.160 --> 04:06.660]  Instead of trying to sell that one boring phone case in\n",
            "[04:06.660 --> 04:09.160]  a million different marketing ways, it's just not going to\n",
            "[04:09.160 --> 04:11.660]  work out how you would want it to. Number three, you're\n",
            "[04:11.660 --> 04:14.060]  going to have happy customers because you can provide them\n",
            "[04:14.060 --> 04:17.460]  with instant gratification, which is how most people are living\n",
            "[04:17.460 --> 04:20.260]  their life right now, especially through social media scrolling\n",
            "[04:20.260 --> 04:21.260]  super super quick.\n",

            "[04:29.860 --> 04:33.560]  So really what I'm meaning is easy customer support because\n",
            "[04:33.660 --> 04:35.860]  you don't have to worry about shipping labels and returns\n",
            "[04:35.860 --> 04:36.460]  etc.\n",
            "[04:36.460 --> 04:38.560]  Number four here at the profit margins are just literally\n",
            "[04:38.560 --> 04:39.160]  insane.\n",
            "[04:39.160 --> 04:42.260]  You have no product costs and the last piece I put here is\n",
            "[04:42.260 --> 04:43.560]  you can sell globally.\n",
            "[04:43.560 --> 04:46.560]  Literally, anyone that has the ability to purchase your product\n",
            "[04:46.560 --> 04:48.360]  can access it and get it instantly.\n",
            "[04:48.360 --> 04:51.560]  Now, the ultimate slight edge that you're going to have as a digital\n",
            "[04:51.560 --> 04:55.560]  dropshipping business owner is that you are not like the others.\n",
            "[04:55.560 --> 04:59.160]  You are not dropshipping physical products and stuck in some type\n",
            "[04:59.160 --> 05:01.860]  of never-ending product testing loop.\n",
            "[05:01.860 --> 05:03.460]  It's a super busy space.\n",
            "[05:03.460 --> 05:05.760]  Everyone's trying to sell the same products with the same marketing\n",
            "[05:05.760 --> 05:09.260]  angles and most people are just hoping for a breakthrough when\n",
            "[05:09.260 --> 05:11.660]  in reality, they're just playing a numbers game.\n",
            "[05:11.660 --> 05:16.060]  So yes, you might at some point make a few sales, but how many\n",
            "[05:16.060 --> 05:17.260]  products did you test before that?\n",

            "[05:36.260 --> 05:38.960]  So this also allows for us to have a much lower cost per\n",

            "[05:55.680 --> 05:59.760]  Then that would mean we have a 2x return on our ad spend.\n",

            "[06:34.720 --> 06:36.640]  And when we zoom out a little bit and do some math,\n",
            "[06:36.640 --> 06:40.160]  we can multiply each of these profit figures by 10.\n",
            "[06:40.160 --> 06:42.480]  And we could see if we were selling that physical phone case\n",

            "[06:47.360 --> 06:49.760]  So percentage-wise, that's just not great.\n",
            "[06:49.760 --> 06:52.560]  And even as a whole, you're going to have to sell a lot of cases,\n",

            "[03:55.280 --> 03:57.560]  And scrolling down, we're gonna set the daily budget\n",

            "[04:11.880 --> 04:13.400]  to reach the audience we input.\n",

            "[04:18.160 --> 04:21.300]  We can raise these budgets, but this is where we want to start.\n",
            "[04:21.300 --> 04:23.820]  And for example, let's say right now it's close to 8 p.m.\n",
            "[04:23.820 --> 04:27.760]  If I was to launch this ad and it goes into review after you publish it.\n",

            "[04:32.740 --> 04:37.260]  p.m., it's going to spend my entire budget between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m.\n",
            "[04:37.260 --> 04:41.060]  But instead what I prefer to do when launching new ads later in the day is just schedule\n",
            "[04:41.060 --> 04:42.060]  it for the next day.\n",
            "[04:42.060 --> 04:45.740]  So that way my budget is going to be spent throughout an entire day instead of just a\n",
            "[04:45.740 --> 04:47.380]  couple hours of time.\n",
            "[04:47.380 --> 04:51.340]  And at a dollar, I know it doesn't seem like much, but it does make a difference.\n",
            "[04:51.340 --> 04:54.860]  And we're not going to set an end date, scroll down, and now what we're going to do is input\n",
            "[04:54.860 --> 04:55.860]  our audiences.\n",
            "[04:55.860 --> 04:59.880]  So we're going to remove the specific location because our custom audience could include\n",
            "[04:59.880 --> 05:01.580]  people from all over the world.\n",
            "[05:01.580 --> 05:05.460]  And since it's retargeting, I typically don't get very specific on it, especially here when\n",
            "[05:05.460 --> 05:07.860]  our audiences are probably pretty small, just starting out.\n",
            "[05:07.860 --> 05:11.340]  So inside of this first warm ad set, what we're going to be doing is including these\n",
            "[05:11.340 --> 05:12.820]  audiences that we made.\n",
            "[05:12.820 --> 05:15.900]  our video views audience, our Instagram engagers audience,\n",
            "[05:15.900 --> 05:18.180]  and our Facebook engaging audience.\n",
            "[05:18.180 --> 05:19.420]  So all three of those.\n",
            "[05:19.420 --> 05:20.700]  And then once those are included,\n",
            "[05:20.700 --> 05:22.060]  we're going to click exclude,\n",
            "[05:22.060 --> 05:25.340]  and we're going to exclude page viewers seven.\n",
            "[05:25.340 --> 05:27.460]  And then scrolling down throughout the ad set level,\n",
            "[05:27.460 --> 05:29.220]  we're not going to change anything.\n",
            "[05:29.220 --> 05:31.820]  We're going to leave everything exactly how it is.\n",
            "[05:31.820 --> 05:34.700]  And then comes next, the ad creative level.\n",
            "[05:34.700 --> 05:37.480]  And we're going to be placing two ad creatives under each.\n",
            "[05:37.480 --> 05:40.560]  So I'm going to name this first one, warm ad one,\n",
            "[05:40.560 --> 05:42.140]  and then make sure it's selected\n",

            "[05:46.980 --> 05:48.520]  And ad set number two is gonna be\n",
            "[05:48.520 --> 05:51.420]  the exact same setup process for our hot audiences,\n",
            "[05:51.420 --> 05:54.020]  which is gonna be all website visitors 180,\n",
            "[05:54.020 --> 05:56.660]  excluding the purchases 30 audience.\n",
            "[05:56.660 --> 05:59.280]  Except first we wanna input the ad creatives\n",
            "[05:59.280 --> 06:01.740]  for our first ad set and then publish it\n",
            "[06:01.740 --> 06:03.300]  before we create the second one.\n",
            "[06:03.300 --> 06:05.000]  So I wanna go over ad creatives now\n",
            "[06:05.000 --> 06:06.920]  because this is really the most important part.\n",
            "[06:06.920 --> 06:08.700]  So here in the ad creative level,\n",
            "[06:08.700 --> 06:10.300]  this is gonna be the content\n",
            "[06:10.300 --> 06:12.540]  that the people we're targeting with our ads\n",
            "[06:12.540 --> 06:16.680]  are going to be seeing, the video, the text, et cetera.\n",
            "[06:16.680 --> 06:18.460]  So we need to make sure it's correct.\n",
            "[06:18.460 --> 06:21.380]  And really this is the most important part of our campaign.\n",
            "[06:21.380 --> 06:23.420]  Aside from the audiences we've selected,\n",
            "[06:23.420 --> 06:25.120]  many people think success with ads\n",
            "[06:25.120 --> 06:27.060]  has to do with the button pushing itself,\n",
            "[06:27.060 --> 06:28.340]  but really that's not the case.\n",
            "[06:28.340 --> 06:29.780]  So what we're gonna be doing\n",
            "[06:29.780 --> 06:32.980]  is placing those two ad creatives under each ad set.\n",
            "[06:32.980 --> 06:36.260]  And our warm ad creatives are gonna be focusing on value\n",
            "[06:36.260 --> 06:37.260]  plus a call to action,\n",
            "[06:37.260 --> 06:38.560]  kind of like the examples I showed you\n",
            "[06:38.560 --> 06:39.620]  in the video previously.\n",
            "[06:39.620 --> 06:43.580]  And our hot ad set creatives are going to focus on incentive plus call to action.\n",
            "[06:43.580 --> 06:47.660]  So an incentive is just a reason for someone to actually come back to our website and make\n",
            "[06:47.660 --> 06:48.660]  that purchase.\n",
            "[06:48.660 --> 06:53.060]  So an example could be a discount or a bonus, which is something I'm going to cover here,\n",
            "[06:53.060 --> 06:55.120]  which I really like for the digital dropshipping method.\n",
            "[06:55.120 --> 06:59.580]  So right now what we're going to do is create new video content in the same style we've\n",
            "[06:59.580 --> 07:04.980]  been using for organic, but instead focusing on one of these direct purposes, specifically\n",
            "[07:04.980 --> 07:07.260]  for the warm and hot audiences.\n",
            "[07:07.260 --> 07:11.080]  And the reason why we don't use the same exact content is because it's already familiar.\n",
            "[07:11.080 --> 07:12.980]  These are warm and hot audiences.\n",
            "[07:12.980 --> 07:17.420]  So what we're going to do is search for our most popular pieces of organic content across\n",
            "[07:17.420 --> 07:22.260]  TikTok or Instagram Reels, and we're going to restructure them to be profitable ad creators\n",
            "[07:22.260 --> 07:23.260]  for retargeting.\n",
            "[07:23.260 --> 07:24.760]  And here's how we're going to do it.\n",
            "[07:24.760 --> 07:28.780]  This is a script example from a previous video, and you can see here in the modified section\n",
            "[07:28.780 --> 07:33.980]  for the warm audience, we're essentially just densing down the content to have a specific\n",
            "[07:33.980 --> 07:37.180]  call to action because before we're just building rapport on\n",
            "[07:37.180 --> 07:38.180]  the organic strategy.\n",
            "[07:38.180 --> 07:40.480]  So we say, you know, let us know in the comments if you want\n",
            "[07:40.480 --> 07:42.480]  to learn more about this, but here for our warm audience,\n",
            "[07:42.480 --> 07:44.180]  these are people who have already engaged.\n",
            "[07:44.180 --> 07:45.780]  We've already seen some content.\n",
            "[07:45.780 --> 07:48.680]  So instead what we're doing is getting people more familiar\n",
            "[07:48.680 --> 07:51.080]  with our solution with is the breath work.\n",
            "[07:51.080 --> 07:53.380]  So we're hitting their pain points as well here in the example\n",
            "[07:53.380 --> 07:56.480]  with mental roadblocks make better decisions and the call\n",
            "[07:56.480 --> 08:00.280]  to action is visit the link below to learn more and ultimately\n",
            "[08:00.280 --> 08:02.980]  our objective here with the warm audience retargeting is\n",
            "[08:02.980 --> 08:05.580]  to get people who have engaged but not been to our website to\n",
            "[08:05.580 --> 08:07.080]  actually go to our website.\n",
            "[08:07.080 --> 08:09.280]  And if they go to our website and don't buy anything then\n",
            "[08:09.280 --> 08:11.480]  they're going to get hit with our hot audience ads.\n",
            "[08:11.780 --> 08:15.780]  And this is my example for the hot audience creatives based\n",
            "[08:15.780 --> 08:17.980]  on that first original video script.\n",
            "[08:17.980 --> 08:21.080]  The hook is every future millionaire needs this so directly\n",
            "[08:21.080 --> 08:24.680]  to our ideal customer and the value is today when you join\n",
            "[08:24.680 --> 08:27.780]  the community, we're going to include the full guided Breath\n",
            "[08:27.780 --> 08:29.780]  for Bros beginner session.\n",
            "[08:30.080 --> 08:32.680]  Get your bonus today by clicking the link below and that's\n",
            "[08:32.680 --> 08:36.420]  That's an example of a very strong incentive because we aren't selling physical products\n",
            "[08:36.420 --> 08:41.840]  where we can say, okay, here's a free shipping, you know, we don't have to ship products physically.\n",
            "[08:41.840 --> 08:43.440]  They're instantly delivered to our customer.\n",
            "[08:43.440 --> 08:47.880]  So even here in an incentive, it could be something like, you know, get this delivered\n",
            "[08:47.880 --> 08:50.880]  instantly to your email or a certain discount code.\n",
            "[08:50.880 --> 08:55.820]  You only want to offer custom incentives like a discount specifically to your hot audiences,\n",
            "[08:55.820 --> 08:58.300]  because those are people who have been to your website, but for whatever reason, didn't\n",
            "[08:58.300 --> 09:00.880]  trust you enough or like the product enough to buy it.\n",
            "[09:00.880 --> 09:04.380]  But by offering an exclusive discount, that's going to incentivize them to come back and\n",
            "[09:04.380 --> 09:06.080]  complete their purchase.\n",
            "[09:06.080 --> 09:09.600]  So step number four is to actually publish this campaign.\n",
            "[09:09.600 --> 09:15.240]  So it's going to be one campaign, two ad sets, one warm, one hot, both spending $1 per day\n",
            "[09:15.240 --> 09:18.120]  with two specific ad creatives under each.\n",
            "[09:18.120 --> 09:20.440]  Your warm ad creatives are going to be different from your hot ones.\n",
            "[09:20.440 --> 09:23.160]  And when we publish our campaign, it's going to go into review.\n",
            "[09:23.160 --> 09:27.080]  Now what I want to do is show you my winning column set up on Facebook so that you can\n",
            "[09:27.080 --> 09:30.200]  save time and copy them directly to your own ad account.\n",
            "[09:30.200 --> 09:32.280]  So you can know what you're looking at at all times.\n",
            "[09:32.280 --> 09:35.880]  So what you're going to do here inside of your Facebook ads manager is go to columns\n",
            "[09:35.880 --> 09:38.280]  and then you're going to click customize columns.\n",
            "[09:38.280 --> 09:40.920]  And then these are my favorites.\n",
            "[09:40.920 --> 09:44.040]  So I'm going to scroll through here real quick so you can see them.\n",
            "[09:44.040 --> 09:47.160]  And essentially what you're going to do is exit out of all the ones you currently have\n",
            "[09:47.160 --> 09:48.280]  on your default tab.\n",
            "[09:48.280 --> 09:52.120]  And then you're just going to type in what I have and then save it,\n",
            "[09:52.120 --> 09:54.360]  apply after you have all of them selected like I do.\n",
            "[09:54.360 --> 09:57.320]  And once you've done that, there's going to be a little save button next to it here.\n",
            "[09:57.320 --> 09:59.480]  You're going to save it, name it whatever you want,\n",
            "[09:59.480 --> 10:01.280]  and then set as defaults.\n",
            "[10:01.280 --> 10:03.960]  Now, every time you log into your Facebook Ads Manager,\n",
            "[10:03.960 --> 10:06.280]  these are the certain data points which you're gonna see,\n",
            "[10:06.280 --> 10:07.920]  which to me are most important.\n",
            "[10:07.920 --> 10:10.640]  So I can see exactly how much money I'm spending,\n",
            "[10:10.640 --> 10:13.420]  how many sales I've gotten and the conversion value of that,\n",
            "[10:13.420 --> 10:15.140]  and all these different metrics\n",
            "[10:15.140 --> 10:17.240]  to see how my ad creators are performing,\n",
            "[10:17.240 --> 10:19.840]  which is gonna be a future video here inside this program\n",
            "[10:19.840 --> 10:21.520]  to analyzing your ads.\n",
            "[10:21.520 --> 10:23.680]  But one key metric that I want you to focus on\n",
            "[10:23.680 --> 10:26.440]  after you launch your retargeting here is frequency.\n",
            "[10:26.440 --> 10:28.600]  So the frequency is really just a number\n",
            "[10:28.600 --> 10:30.720]  of how many times someone has seen your ad.\n",
            "[10:30.720 --> 10:32.840]  And for retargeting, since our audiences are smaller,\n",
            "[10:32.840 --> 10:35.620]  typically someone's gonna see the same ad multiple times.\n",
            "[10:35.620 --> 10:37.800]  But on the maximum timeframe,\n",
            "[10:37.800 --> 10:40.160]  when we look at this number here for our retargeting,\n",
            "[10:40.160 --> 10:43.120]  we don't want our frequency to go above eight.\n",
            "[10:43.120 --> 10:44.260]  If it does go above eight,\n",
            "[10:44.260 --> 10:46.060]  then we're gonna have to lower the budget\n",
            "[10:46.060 --> 10:48.440]  so we're not just completely spending and wasting money\n",
            "[10:48.440 --> 10:50.520]  targeting the same people who haven't bought\n",
            "[10:50.520 --> 10:51.920]  with the same ads.\n",
            "[10:51.920 --> 10:53.880]  And one of the ways we combat the high frequency\n",
            "[10:53.880 --> 10:55.520]  is by using, like we've done,\n",
            "[10:55.520 --> 10:58.120]  multiple ad creatives under each ad set.\n",
            "[10:58.120 --> 11:00.520]  So that way someone's not seeing the same exact ad all the\n",
            "[11:00.520 --> 11:03.320]  time, but instead we're pushing them a couple different ones\n",
            "[11:03.320 --> 11:05.520]  and hopefully one of them catches their attention enough to\n",
            "[11:05.520 --> 11:07.520]  take that next step with our brand.\n",
            "[11:07.520 --> 11:10.020]  Now, if your frequency after a few days of running is at like\n",
            "[11:10.020 --> 11:12.720]  a two or three, then that means you have a decent audience\n",
            "[11:12.720 --> 11:16.420]  size where you can raise this budget from $1 to let's say $2\n",
            "[11:16.420 --> 11:18.920]  per day each and then from there just continue scaling that\n",
            "[11:18.920 --> 11:22.420]  budget until the frequency is too high and you need to lower\n",
            "[11:22.420 --> 11:24.820]  it down and ultimately the advertising strategies and\n",
            "[11:24.820 --> 11:27.820]  we're going to be covering here in the next week.\n",
